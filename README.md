## Overview
Eviz is an observability stack tailored for monitoring email servers, Linux systems, and web servers. It provides powerful tools for collecting, visualizing, and analyzing metrics and logs, enabling administrators to gain insights into the performance, health, and security of their infrastructure.

## Features
- **Email Server Monitoring:** Monitor key metrics such as email throughput, delivery rates, bounce rates, and queue sizes.
- **Linux System Monitoring:** Track system resource usage, network activity, disk I/O, CPU load, and memory utilization.
- **Web Server Monitoring:** Monitor web server response times, request rates, error rates, and server resource consumption.
- **Dashboard Customization:** Create custom dashboards tailored to your specific monitoring needs.
- **Alerting and Notification:** Set up alerts based on predefined thresholds or anomalies and receive notifications via email, SMS, or other channels.
- **Log Management:** Centralize logs from email servers, Linux systems, and web servers for analysis and troubleshooting.
